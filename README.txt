CLImax is a php cli framework.

CLImax makes it dead-easy for you to build CLI programs in php:
- Custom apps for managing your project
- General-purpose CLI apps writen in PHP

See the "climax" executable for an example.

Philosophy and Opinions

CLImax is designed to make it trivially easy to create beautiful CLI apps. This is abort more than the CLI interface; it extends to the application itself.

CLImax is highly flexible under the hood, allowing you to structure your CLI app however you like; however it includes support for a conventional way to structure commands and arguments in a way that is easy to maintain and use.
